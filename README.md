# Clustering-on-World-Food-Facts-Dataset
Utilizing the dataset from Kaggle, which gives the content of common nutrients(fat, carbohydrates, sugars, proteins, salt and energy) of each food product, this project establishes an unsupervised model to fit the products into different clusters. In order to better visualize the result of clustering, PCA is also performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data
